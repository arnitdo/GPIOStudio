#Instructions on how to run a generated program -

1)  If you are using Remote Scripts, you do not need to make any modifications.
	Simply enter the raspberry pi's IP address, and press Run Remote

2)	If you are simply building the project, you will need to copy the generated `script.py` file onto your Pi.
Do not run a file generated for Remote Scripts locally on your pi. It will not work. Build the file separately.

If you insert a non - GPIO block, such as `picamera` or `SenseHAT`, Remote Script functionality will be disabled.
You will need to follow step 2 to run the given program
