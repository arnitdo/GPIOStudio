## GPIO Studio
A simple Flow-Based GUI Tool for creating GPIO Scripts on Raspberry Pi

Developed in Qt 5.15.2 , C++11

---
## What is GPIO Studio?

- GPIO Studio is a flow based GUI Tool used to create scripts. These scripts interact with Raspberry Pi GPIO (and a few non-GPIO) components
- You do not need any past programming experience to use this program.
- No code, means no hassle. You do not need to worry about writing incorrect code that can damage your device.
- Point and click. Most of the interface is written in a self explanatory way. Lines connect blocks, blocks generate code one-by-one.
- Where do I get it? Right at the [releases page](https://www.github.com/arnitdo/GPIOStudio/releases/latest). Prebuilt binaries (executables) are available for Windows x86_64 and Linux x86_64
- Want to contribute? Fork it and make the changes you want! I'll happily integrate them, provided they fit the [contribution conditions](https://www.github.com/arnitdo/blob/main/GPIOStudio/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Want to compile it yourself? You will need to install Qt, the instructions for which, are available publicly on the internet.
- Found a problem? Something that irks you off? Something is broken? [Make an issue here!](https://github.com/arnitdo/GPIOStudio/issues/new/choose)
